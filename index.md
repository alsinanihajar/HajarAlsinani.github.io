# Hajar 

I work with data.

My focus is on **data engineering and analytics** — taking raw, messy data and turning it into clean, structured datasets that can actually be used for analysis and dashboards.

This portfolio documents how I work with data end-to-end:  
from ingestion and cleaning, to transformation, validation, and finally reporting using tools like **Power BI**.

Most of the projects here are based on real, imperfect datasets.  
The goal is not just insights, but **reliable data**.

### What you’ll find here
- Data pipelines built in Python and SQL  
- Practical data cleaning and transformation work  
- Analytics-ready datasets  
- Dashboards and reporting projects (Power BI, Tableau)

  ### Projects

#### 1. Student Performance Prediction
**Description**  
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict student performance based on academic and personal factors.  
The goal is to understand which variables most strongly influence student outcomes and how predictive models can support educational insights.

**Dataset**  
- Student Performance Dataset

**Tools & Technologies**  
- Python  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

#### 2. Walmart Sales Analysis
**Description**  
A portfolio project inspired by a case study by Data & Analytics Educator **Mary Knoeferl**.  
This project analyzes Walmart retail sales data to uncover the key factors influencing weekly sales across different stores.

The analysis explores trends, correlations, and patterns related to:
- Store performance  
- Holiday impact  
- Fuel prices  
- CPI (Consumer Price Index)  
- Temperature  
- Unemployment rates  

**Dataset**  
- Publicly available on Kaggle: Walmart Sales Dataset

**Business Questions**
- How do holidays affect weekly sales?  
- Which stores have the lowest and highest unemployment rates?  
- Is there a correlation between CPI and weekly sales?  
- How does the correlation differ when the Holiday Flag is `0` vs `1`?  
- Why is fuel price included in the dataset, and how does it compare to other factors?

**Tools & Technologies**
- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

#### 3. Student Performance SQL Analysis
**Description**  
How can students improve their exam performance?

In this project, I analyze student performance data using SQL.  
The dataset includes information about study habits, sleep patterns, and extracurricular activities.  
The goal is to apply SQL-based data manipulation and analytical techniques to identify the factors that most impact exam scores.

**Key Questions**
- Which factors are most associated with high exam scores?  
- Do students who participate in extracurricular activities perform better?  
- Is there an optimal range of study hours for better performance?  
- How can ranking be used to evaluate performance while preserving student privacy?

**Key Insights**
- Students who study more than 10 hours per week and participate in extracurricular activities tend to achieve higher exam scores.  
- The best exam performance is observed among students studying between **11 and 16 hours per week**.  
- Student ranking is used instead of raw exam scores to compare performance without exposing individual results.

**Tools & Technologies**
- SQL
